</br>
<h3>How does Workbench use cookies and web beacons?</h3>
<h5>Workbench and its marketing, analytics and fraud prevention service providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about Workbench’s user base, and we may receive such information on an individual and aggregated basis from such providers.
</br></br>
We use cookies to provide you with a personalized experience by recognizing you when you return to the Workbench Sites; better understand our users by tracking how they use the Workbench Services; improve the design and content of the Workbench Sites by tracking how users interact with the Workbench Sites; and identify and prevent fraudulent activity. You can change your browser settings to refuse cookies, but this may interfere with your use of the Workbench Sites.
</br></br>
We gather certain information about our website visitors automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you in order to provide and improve the Workbench Services.
</br></br>
We may partner with a third party to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this website and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you do not want this information to be used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. This does not opt you out of being served ads and you will continue to receive generic ads.
</br></br>
We use Local Shared Objects, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website also use Flash cookies and HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please click here.
</br></br>
The Workbench Sites include social media features that allow you to “Like” or share content on third party sites. These features may be hosted by the third party sites or the Workbench Sites, and may collect your IP address, the Workbench Site page you are visiting, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third party cookies, web beacons, social media features and widgets (such as the Facebook Like button), or other tracking technologies used by third parties. Workbench is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties.</h5>
